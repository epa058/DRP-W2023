An expository paper on the resolution of the Yamabe problem (I just needed somewhere to showcase it). The paper is self-contained; it is intended for those with only a foundational background in analysis and contains a brief introduction to differential geometry and geometric analysis.

Mentor: Samuel Zeitler
